├── study/                    # The actual Git repo with commits and tag
│   ├── .git/                 # Hidden Git history (already initialized)
│   ├── data/
│   ├── analysis/
│   ├── figures/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ... (tag v1.0 exists here)
├── directory_structure.py    # Scaffolding-only script
├── git_fraud_casebuilder.py  # Full fraud simulation & Git commits
├── .gitignore                # Optional: ignore .pyc, __pycache__/
└── README.md                 # Instructions for interns (see below)

## 🧳 What to Push

You only need to push the **outer repo** (not the inner `.git/` from `study/`). Here's how:

### 1. Create a New GitHub Repo

Call it something like `git-audit-lab` or `ethical-research-lab`.

### 2. From Terminal, in your `Documents`:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
mkdir git-audit-lab
mv study git-audit-lab/
mv git_fraud_casebuilder.py git-audit-lab/
mv directory_structure.py git-audit-lab/
cd git-audit-lab
touch README.md .gitignore
```

### 3. Initialize a *new* outer repo (not the one inside `study/`):

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup with study case and setup scripts"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/git-audit-lab.git
git push -u origin main
```

> 🔐 Be careful **not** to push `study/.git/` — it’ll confuse things and may violate student repo expectations. This inner repo is meant to be explored, not versioned recursively.

## 🪧 Suggested `README.md` (outer repo)

````markdown
# Git Audit Lab 🧪

This training kit teaches version control as an ethical tool, using a real-world inspired case of data manipulation.

## 🔍 Files

- `directory_structure.py`: Builds an empty research directory structure.
- `git_fraud_casebuilder.py`: Simulates data fraud and commits changes to a Git repo inside `/study`.

## 📁 study/

This is a Git repo **within** the folder—interns should `cd study/` and run forensic audits using:

```bash
git log
git diff HEAD~1
git checkout HEAD~1
````

They can analyze data and explore what changed, when, and why it matters.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

* Practice Git forensically (not just for versioning)
* Spot dishonest commit patterns
* Reproduce analysis before and after data tampering

## 🚀 Setup

```bash
python git_fraud_casebuilder.py
cd study
python analysis/analyze.py
```

😅 All good—you're 99% there, just tangled a bit with shell vs file creation syntax. Here's how to cleanly finish the job:

---

## 🧼 Final Fix: Create `.gitignore` Properly

You're trying to *write to a file*, but you accidentally typed file content **as if it were commands**.

Let’s do it right now.

---

### ✅ Option 1: One-Liner (fastest)

```bash
echo "study/.git/
__pycache__/
*.pyc" > .gitignore
```

Then push:

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore to ignore nested Git and bytecode"
git push
```

---

### ✅ Option 2: Use `nano`

```bash
nano .gitignore
```

Then paste the following **inside the editor**:

```
study/.git/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```

Save:

* Press `Ctrl+O`, then `Enter`
* Press `Ctrl+X` to exit

Then:

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore to ignore nested Git and bytecode"
git push
```

---

## 🎯 You're Done When...

1. `git status` shows a clean tree
2. `.gitignore` is committed
3. Your GitHub repo shows:

   * `README.md`
   * `directory_structure.py`
   * `git_fraud_casebuilder.py`
   * `study/` (with data/scripts)
   * `.gitignore`

You just built an entire forensic ethics lab with version control. Your interns won’t even know how good they have it. 🧠🔥 Let me know if you want a clean `report_template.md` for them to write up findings.
